"Brave Browser")

**Brave Browser** is an *open source* web browser which is based on *Chrome and Blink engine*. The application is used to browse faster, safer and ad-free. This browser loads the pages 2 times faster than other web browsers on PC and 8 times faster on a mobile. It has more privacy protection than any other browsers and blocks ads and web tracker.

Unlike other browsing apps like Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox Brave browser has a smooth and intuitive UI. The most interesting feature that has impressed me in choosing this application is that if the user agrees to replace the ads with any anonymous ads from the network the user will be awarded a bitcoin.

The main buy-in from this application is that it was built to satisfy the privacy concerns of the users. Nowadays most of the users are annoyed when ads pop up every time we surf on various websites, to avoid this brave has this wonderful feature of blocking ads, scripts, phishing and many more. Using this application, the users can browser peacefully with no ads popping up. The user can even customize the shields for a particular site.

The application uses *Artificial Intelligence (AI)* to block ads better than any other plug-ins. It also uses blockchain-based tokens called as Basic Attention Tokens (BAT) an open-source, decentralized ad exchange platform based on Ethereum, founded by Brendan Eich. BAT comprises of various components, including attention measurement systems, analytics dashboards, and machine learning algorithms.

The major strengths of this application are its user-friendly UI, privacy and security, automatic upgradation of sites to HTTPS for secure and encrypted communication and the blocking of ads. **DuckDuckGo** is a search engine that does not track your search history, enabling you to search privately. Initially, there were few problems like taking screenshots on Mac unless brave is on the background and many of the extensions were not supported on it, but all these issues were solved in the later updates.

**AdGraph: Graph-based Machine Learning Approach**

A betterment that can be focused is to enhance the ability to predict the ads and trackers and automate the whole process of blocking. AdGraph is a *Machine Learning* approach proposed to effectively block the ads which outperform the normal ad-blocking filters. The AdGraph approach has the ability to block the ads and trackers with 97.7% accuracy. It also blocks 16% more ads than normal filters with 65% accuracy.


## TEZ (Google Pay)

**Tez** is a digital mobile payments application which is used to transfer money securely from anyone straight away from our bank. It operates on top of the *Unified Payments Interface*, developed by the *National Payments Corporation of India*. This app can be used where UPI payments are accepted like paying in shops, online purchase and many more. Tez was renamed to Google Pay on August 28, 2018. It is secure since it has multiple layers of security from your bank. This application was developed targeting the users in India.

While comparing it with other UPI applications, this application was chosen for its unique payment methods. Unlike other wallet services like Paytm or PhonePe were the money will be deposited in the wallet and that must be transferred to the bank thereafter. But in Tez we can easily perform bank to bank exchange without the use of any intermediate wallet which rather spares time and is also protected by Tez Shields.

This application has made life simpler, it also supports many Indian languages like Hindi, Tamil, Kannada, Telugu and many more. After the introduction of Tez transaction have been made easier within the snap of our fingers. For instance, if a transaction must be made by the user they have to visit the bank. But this app has made it much easier by transferring funds from where we sit. With these features this app seems to be a great buy for the users.

Tez leverages a technology called as Audio QR, that enables clients to exchange cash utilizing sounds to pair two gadgets. In these waves are been used to make payments in a secure and safe way. Since this audio QR is used the users need not share any of their personal information or mobile numbers for doing the payment.

The application is simple to use, and everything comes within the swipe of your finger. Tez can also be used as a chat window to text your friends. This is more secure than any other application, every transaction is secured with a UPI PIN and your fingerprint this gives the application a two-layer authentication making it more difficult to hack. And another interesting thing is you get a Google Pay Scratch Card with which you can get rewards which directly goes into the bank account. Apart from these we can also do payments such as electricity bill, phone bills, internet bills and many more. The weakness in this application is that it is limited only to transfer Indian rupees. 

An improvement that I would like to suggest for this application is that,since it is only limited within India it would be better if the application is made globally available.
